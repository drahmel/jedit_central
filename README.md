# jEdit Central
Fork of jEdit program editor that includes builds, plugins, resources, etc.

# Objective

jEdit is a fantastic program editor that -- to this day -- is competitive with more modern editors such as VS Code, sublime, etc. Unfortunately, many engineers think jEdit is only for Java. Far from it! In fact, I rarely code in Java anymore, but I use jEdit daily for developing in Python, Solidity, Bash, PHP, Javascript, React Native, etc.

Finding update-to-date resources is becoming more difficult (including new versions of plugins that aren't pushed to the repos) as other editors gain popularity. In this fork, I'll attempt to try and collect today many of modes, plugins, resources, and builds so people who want to use/modify/contribute to jEdit can do so easily. So please fork and add pull requests! We'll merge everything together.

Also, if you use jEdit, please donate at the main website (http://www.jedit.org/) so they keep it running. Since I use jEdit every day, I donate every year to keep jEdit supported. If you use it, please donate too! (http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=588)

# Plugins

I'm including builds of plugins here in case the plugin download mirrors go offline. Use the Plugin Manager if possible, but if you can't find a build of a plugin that adds a feature or fixes a bug that is mentioned in the jedit-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, you can check here.

To add a plugin, in most cases you can just copy it to your /jars folder and reboot jEdit.
