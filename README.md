# jedit_central
Fork of jEdit program editor that includes builds, plugins, resources, etc.

# Objective

jEdit is a fantastic program editor that -- to this day -- is competitive with more modern editors such as VS Code, sublime, etc. Unfortunately, many engineers think jEdit is only for Java. Far from it! In fact, I rarely code in Java anymore, but I use jEdit daily for developing in Python, Solidity, Bash, PHP, Javascript, React Native, etc.

Finding resources, though, are becoming more difficult as other editors gain popularity. In this fork, I'm going to try and collect today many of modes, plugins, resources, and builds so people that want to use/modify/contribute to jedit can do it easily. So please fork and add pull requests! We'll merge everything together.

Also, if you use jEdit, please donate at the main website (http://www.jedit.org/) so they keep it running. Since I use jEdit every day, I donate every year to keep jEdit supported. If you use it, please donate too! (http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=588)
